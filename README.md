Rotation of the red knob shifts the image in the x-axis, the green knob in the y-axis. Rotation of the blue knob changes the parameter for fractal computation. The parameter is selected from a list of values with optically interesting output.
-----
Pushing the red knob zooms the image out, the green knob zooms out. When the blue knob is pushed, gallery mode is activated. The parameter from a list of values with optically interesting output changes periodically in gallery mode - every 2 seconds. When the blue knob is pushed again, gallery mode is deactivated. Zoom in and out is not available in gallery mode.
